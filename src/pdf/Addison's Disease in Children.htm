    <h1>Addison's Disease in Children</h1>
    <p>
      Addison's disease is when the adrenal glands don't make enough of two
      steroid hormones. The hormones are cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol
      controls the body's metabolism, blocks inflammatory reactions, and affects
      the immune system. Aldosterone manages sodium and potassium levels. The
      adrenal glands sit on top of the kidneys. There is one gland on top of
      each kidney. Addison's disease is fairly rare and may first appear at any
      age.
    </p>

    <h2>What causes Addison's disease in a child?</h2>
    <p>
      The most common cause of Addison's disease is damage to the adrenal glands
      caused by an autoimmune disease. Other cases of Addison's disease are
      caused by damage to the glands by any of these:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cancer</li>
      <li>Infection</li>
      <li>An autoimmune problem</li>
      <li>A rare genetic disease</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In rare cases, Addison's disease is passed down in a family.</p>

    <h2>Who's at risk?</h2>
    <p>
      A child is at risk for Addison's disease if they have any of the
      following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An autoimmune disease</li>
      <li>Cancer</li>
      <li>Infection such as tuberculosis</li>
      <li>Family history of the disease</li>
      <li>History of using corticosteroid medicine</li>
      <li>History of using antifungal medicine</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Symptoms of Addison's disease in a child</h2>
    <p>
      Mild symptoms may only occur when a child is under physical stress.
      Symptoms may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Muscle weakness</li>
      <li>Fatigue</li>
      <li>Dizziness</li>
      <li>Fast pulse</li>
      <li>Dark skin, first seen on hands and face</li>
      <li>Black freckles</li>
      <li>
        Bluish-black color around the nipples, mouth, rectum, scrotum, or vagina
      </li>
      <li>Weight loss</li>
      <li>Dehydration</li>
      <li>Loss of appetite</li>
      <li>Intense salt craving</li>
      <li>Muscle aches</li>
      <li>Nausea</li>
      <li>Vomiting</li>
      <li>Diarrhea</li>
      <li>Intolerance to cold</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These symptoms can be similar to other health conditions, so it's
      important to consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis.
    </p>

    <h2>Addison's disease diagnosis</h2>
    <p>
      Diagnosis may include laboratory blood tests, an ACTH stimulation test to
      assess adrenal function, and measurement of electrolytes in the blood.
    </p>

    <h2>Treatment for Addison's disease</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of treatment is to replace the missing hormones and relieve the
      symptoms. Corticosteroid medicine, often taken for life, may be
      prescribed, and additional medication might be necessary to manage sodium
      and potassium levels.
    </p>

    <h2>Possible complications</h2>
    <p>
      If left untreated, Addison's disease can lead to severe complications such
      as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Severe abdominal pain</li>
      <li>Extreme weakness</li>
      <li>Low blood pressure</li>
      <li>Kidney failure</li>
      <li>Shock from dehydration</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Addison's disease is caused by insufficient production of cortisol and
        aldosterone by the adrenal glands.
      </li>
      <li>The most common cause is autoimmune damage to the adrenal glands.</li>
      <li>Treatment involves lifelong hormone replacement therapy.</li>
      <li>
        Untreated Addison's disease can lead to severe complications, especially
        during physical stress.
      </li>
    </ul>
